Following potentially curative NSCLC surgery follow up is for 5 years. Outlined here and updated 2024.

| Time post surgery | Proposed |
|-------------------|----------|
| 3 months          | CXR      |
| 6 months          | CT       |
| 9 months          | CXR      |
| 12 months         | CT       |
| 18 months         | CT       |
| 24 months         | CT       |
| Yearly to 5 years* | CT       |

(In line with ESMO 2017 and ASCO guidelines 2019)

\* one may wish to continue beyond 5 years in selected patients who would still be for active treatment (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30777897/)
  
because it's a bit annoying to work out every time, you can stick the date of surgery into a calculator I made here:
